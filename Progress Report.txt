subsubsection*{Word frequency index}
\paragraph{} A word frequency dictionary "databaseDict.jason" has been made from the 150,000 tweets, in which the words with special characters has been filtered out, like "@" for replying, "\#" for comments, "\\" for file paths. This dictionary will be used for generating the candidate word list for an error words since we the word frequency will be used as the probability of a certain word in Bayesian function. From the dictionary, we see many of the "word"s only has a frequency of 1, we assumed that words with a frequency of 1 has a very high possibilities to be a spelling error and words with a high frequency (threshold of 3~4) will be a correct spelling.     
\subsubsection*{Inverse phonetic index}
\paragraph{} The Inverse phonetic index Dictionary "soundexDict.jason" has been established based on the Soundex phonetic algorithm\footnote{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex}{Soundex}}, which is for indexing words by sound, as pronounced in English. We indexed each of the words in the 150,000 tweets to its phonetic index and whenever we find a spelling error, we will assume that the corrected words that has a same phonetic index will be in the candidate word list.
