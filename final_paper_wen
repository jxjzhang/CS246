\subsubsection*{Phonetic candidates: Soundex}
\paragraph{} A phonetic algorithm is an algorithm for indexing of words by their pronunciation. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. We believe that words have the same or similar representation might have a high possibility to be mispelled to each other. There are lots of complex algorithms phonetic mappings. Among the best known phonetic algorithms are: Soundex, Daitch_Mokotoff Soundex, Kolner Phonetik, Metaphone, Double Metaphone, New York State Identification and Intelligence System, Match Rating Approach, etc. In this paper, we use Soundex and Double Metaphone algorithms for generating the phonetic candidate list for each misspelling word.

\paragraph{} Soundex is the most widely known algorithm of all phonetic algorithm. The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter.The Soundex code for a name consists of one letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants.The specific algorithm can be checked here\footnote{\href{http://www.sound-ex.com/soundex_method.htm}{soundex algorithm}.

\paragraph{} In this project, we indexed each of the words in the 150,000 tweets to its phonetic index and create an inverted phoentic dictionary that map each phonetic representation to a list of words that shares the same phoentic representation. For example, "people" will be map[ed to p140, and in the soundex inverted phonetic map (p140), we get the word list [ ‘peaple’, ‘peopleeee’,  ‘piebbal’, ‘people', 'peple', 'pupil’,'puffle', 'peoople','peoplle', 'pueblo',  'phaphela', 'pahabol’ ,'people", 'people', 'payable', 'paypal', 'peopleee', 'pablooo', 'papell', 'poeple', 'poweful', 'peopl', 'papal', 'pablo', 'pavel', 'peoiple', 'peoplee', ‘people', 'pebble']. We didn't exclude the mispelled words (words not in the ispell dictionary). The intuition of doing this is the words not in the ispell ditionary might not a "wrong" word and also we have edit distance and other mechanisms to exclude the "wrong" word, so we don't have to filter the word list in this step.

\subsubsection*{Phonetic candidates: Metaphone}
\paragraph{} Metaphone algorithm fundamentally improves the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding.The Double Metaphone phonetic encoding algorithm is the second generation of this algorithm.It is called "Double" because it can return both a primary and a secondary code for a string;For example, encoding tg, while the name "Schmidt" yields a primary code of XMT and a secondary code of SMT—both have XMT in common.Double Metaphone_Dict(“people”): [“PPL”, “”]. In the Inverted Metaphone Dict(“PPL”) :[ ‘peaple’, ‘buble’, ‘babble’, ‘peoplle’,‘pablooo’, 'pupil', 'pppl', 'people’, 'papell', 'pebble', 'peopleeee', 'pueblo', 'peoople', 'payable', 'poeple', 'bubbly', 'bubble', 'peoiple', 'bible', 'bpl', 'bubbaloo', 'piebbal', 'peopl', 'peopleee','people', 'bypoll', 'pablo', 'bhopal', 'papal', 'paypal', 'peoplee‘, 'bobble', 'peple’].

\paragraph{} In our project, we combine and compress the inverted soundex phonetic list and inverted double_metaphone phonetic list and use that as the final phonetic candidate list for each single word in tweets.




Single word result:
We also apply traditional aspell's algorithm, which also returns a candidate list for each single misspelled word as a comparison. The result shows that aspell algorithm produced 303/368 errors, which is much higher than our Twitter purification algorithm. For main reason for the poor performance of aspell algorithm might due to the speciality of noisy text present in tweets and social media.
